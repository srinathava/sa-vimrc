*mailbrowser.txt*	How to use the mailbrowser plugin

 This plugin allows one to view a mail collection similar to the way one
 would view it in a mailer.

 Normally, this file will reside in the plugins directory and be
 automatically sourced.  If not, you must manually source this file
 using :source mailbrowser.vim

 :Mail <filename>
   will bring up an index of the mail contained in the specified file
 :Mail
   will bring up an index of the mail contained in the file specified by the
   $MAIL environment variable
 :SMail
   will open a new window and then do what :Mail would have done


 Keys defined in mail browser index
    s = select what to sort by
    r = reverse the current sort order
    o = open the mail under the cursor in a separate window
        <doubleclick> will do the same as o
 <cr> = open the mail under the cursor in the current window
    u = update the index
    d = mark for deletion (doesn't really work)


 When viewing a mail message:
    i = return to index
    a = toggle viewing all headers
    J = go to next message down in the index
    K = go to next message up in the index


 Globals of use:
   g:mailbrowserSortBy 
       selects the default sort. Choices are 'subject', 'index', or 'from'
       with the optional addition of 'reverse'
       Example (and default):
           let g:mailbrowserSortBy='reverse subject'

   g:mailbrowserMailPath
       Chose the directory to look in for named mail files
       Example (and default):
           let g:mailbrowserMailPath = $HOME . "/Mail"

   g:mailbrowserFromLength
       Chose how many characters of the "from" address to display
       Example (and default):
           let g:mailbrowserFromLength = 25

   g:mailbrowserShowHeaders
       Choose which mail headers will be displayed as part of the message.
       If this is not empty, then headers that do not match this will not be
       displayed.
       Example (and default):
           let g:mailbrowserShowHeaders = '^(Subject:|Date:|From:|To:|Cc:)'

   g:mailbrowserHideHeaders
       Choose which mail headers will NOT be displayed as part of the
       message.  If this is not empty, then headers that match this will not
       be displayed.
       Example (and default):
           let g:mailbrowserHideHeaders = ""
